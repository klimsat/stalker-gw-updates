"Dvojka" is very popular in the Exclusion Zone due to its versatility. Bear in mind, however, that the oil requires adequate tools to be spread properly and so that it can reach deep into weapon's inner mechanisms. "Dvojka" should thus be regarded as more of an add-on than a stand-alone maintenance item.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] technological item\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] liquid gun oil and cleaning solvent\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] usable for repairing equipment\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] not usable below condition level: %c[0,170,170,170]90%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] base condition gain: %c[0,170,170,170]8%\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]SUPPORTED MATERIALS:\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] additional gun oils %c[0,170,170,170]+3-6%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] additional cleaning solvents %c[0,170,170,170]+3-7%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] light tools %c[0,170,170,170]+2-5%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] paper (sheets) %c[0,170,170,170]+1-2%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] cloth (sheets) %c[0,170,170,170]+2-4%\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] textile (sheets) %c[0,170,170,170]+2-4%</text>
